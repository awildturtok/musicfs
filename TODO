TODO for the nearest future:
- Add proper debugging facilities.
- Add some generic way of logging, possibly using any fuse API available to do
  this.
- Create a more generic way of mapping a pathname to a file. There are some path
  lookups we'd like to be able to run more than once.
- When calling open, buffer the file descriptors, so we don't open them each
  time, and just read from the filedescriptor. We could behave more fs-like by
  having lists of active nodes as an analogue to inodes in a typical filesystem.
  - Save file descriptors in the struct passed to the open/read/... calls.


v. 0.1
~~~~~~
* Better interface (the new .config is pretty good, but needs
  improvement)

* BUG: musicfs only works in debug mode. Why? Fix this!

* BUG: what to do with songs with out tags? The current behavior,
  breaking badly, is probably not what we want.

v. 0.2(?)
~~~~~~~~~
* Inotify/kqueue support for watching music directories

* Advanced configuration, allowing custom paths. This should be done
  in the configuration file, so something like
  "/Artists/%artist%/%album%/%trackno% %title%.%extension%" (with a
  somewhat prettier syntax ;) would produce the current Artists
  directory.
