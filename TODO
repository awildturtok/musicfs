v. 0.1
~~~~~~
* BUG: fsync errors with /.config

v. 0.2(?)
~~~~~~~~~
* FEATURE: Inotify/kqueue support for watching music directories

  * Take a look at http://mark.heily.com/pnotify/.

  
* FEATURE: Songs without tags (or with empty tags) 
  * We put all songs not having complete tags in an Unsorted folder, with the
    real filename as the name. Perhaps having a flag in the database tables
    indicating that the information is not complete.
  * We avoid including them in the database at all, which is what we basically
    do now, but just a bit more fool proof perhaps.

* Advanced configuration, allowing custom paths. 
This should be done in the configuration file, so something like
"/Artists/%artist%/%album%/%trackno% %title%.%extension%" (with a
somewhat prettier syntax ;) would produce the current Artists
directory.

* Implement support for changing tags by moving a file around in the directory
  tree.
* Implement support for changing encoding my changing file name.
* Implement support for encoding/decoding when reading the data? (embedded
  decoder in the file system, removing the need for encoder support in the
  player).
* Support for looking up tags to CDDB or something like that.
* Internal stuff/convenience

  * Add proper debugging facilities. 
    * DEBUG macro has been improved

  * Add some generic way of logging, possibly using any fuse API
  available to do this.

  * What is the correct way to crash? :) Not at all?

  * Create a more generic way of mapping a pathname to a file. There
  are some path lookups we'd like to be able to run more than once.

* BUG: musicfs only works in debug mode. 
  * -f (foreground mode) also works
  * -s (single thread) does not

  Update: This works if I disable DEBUGGING, probably because of some permission
  problems when using file I/O in not debugging mode.

* File handle stuff for .config (this is a matter of style, not performance)
