~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
musicfs is a FUSE module implementing a media filesystem in
userland. The purpose of musicfs is to provide filesystem hierarchy
based on id3 tags of mp3-files.


Usage
~~~~~
1. Compile:

$ make

2. Initialise the database:

$ sqlite3 music.db < dbschema.sql

3. Run:

$ ./musicfs -d <mount path>

On my computer, it only behaves correctly in debug mode (-d) due to a
bug of some kind. I don't really know why :'(

4. Add music directory:

Edit <mount path>/.config and follow the instructions.


Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- taglib 1.5
- FUSE 2.6
- Sqlite 3
